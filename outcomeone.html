    <p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</p>
    
    <p>Information Technology (IT) is extremely important for all businesses to meet their day to day operational tasks and establish a secure and hassle-free communication flow. Combining IT with marketing and sales helps extend the businesses reach as well maintain fantastic customer relations. It helps businesses to make better use of production and resources, improve profitability, cost reduction over manual tasks and reduce lead times.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</p>
    
    <p>What is a digital project? A digital project comprises the planning, preparation, and production that goes into creating electronic publications. However, nowadays it can be almost anything. A software application, a website, an online campaign, etc. What is true for digital projects is that they're projects delivered as a service to the client. In terms of the overall digital project, the digital project manager should employ a methodology to their plan. KANBAN for example: Which is a visual system for managing your project work as it moves through a process.</p>
    
    <p>The main project plan processes could be broken down into the following areas:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the scope -  it is important first to establish the objectives of the project, which may include a budget, delivery date and goals.</li>
        <li>The team - whose members usually belong to different groups and have different functions and tasks assigned by the project manager.</li>
        <li>The plan - A document or chart that encompassess all the steps of the digital project.</li>
        <li>Management of the project - An essential element that keeps the project on time and within budget.</li>
        <li>Communication - A valuable skill and method that enables you to communicate effectively on the project with your client, team, and other stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Time management - This can flex and change and is a key aspect to managing the project.</li>
        <li>Deadlines - Embedded within the document or chart. Outlines timelines for tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>With all digital projects the methods, skills and resources will be outlined in the overall project plan.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</p>
    
    <p>During this project I’ve utilised Trello. 
        <a href="https://trello.com/b/sRTEekTT/assignment-1-unit-1-dan-affen">Here’s a link to my Trello board for this project</a> . I’ve used it to keep track of the things I've had to do, manage my time and the overall plan as well as  prioritise tasks. My methodology has been KANBAN which I referred to on the previous page. That is, vertically laying out the Trello cards under the headers of “To do”, “In Progress” and “Completed”.</p>
