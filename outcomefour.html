                <p>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</p>

                <p>If you are running a consulting business or any other kind of professional independent services, building a website is more vital than ever before. Nearly every prospective client will visit your website to decide whether or not to trust you with their business, so having a great website can be the difference that swings client decisions in your favor.</p>

                <p>Communicate your value: Write a short sentence or paragraph that explains what makes you unique, and put it front and center on your website.</p>

                <p>Pick a user-friendly website design: A clear, simple design with an easy-to-follow website navigation is your best bet.</p>

                <p>Deliver informative, client-focused content: Offer advice, tips, and solutions that will help your prospective clients, instead of just talking about yourself.</p>

                <p>Include an obvious Contact button: Put a clear call-to-action on your website, where people can click to take the next step.</p>

                <p>Use your website to start building relationships: Add a contact form and links to your social media accounts so you can continue to connect with clients.</p>

                <p>Keep your site fresh. Add new content regularly and optimize your pages so that search engines can find you.</p>

                <p>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </p>

                <p>If you design web sites for others, it is important for all parties to understand ownership.</p>

                <p>Ensure that rights are transferred or licences granted as appropriate. For example; the copyright to the site content and design may passed to the client upon payment, along with licenses for more generic code or modules that the designer/developer may build or use.</p>

                <p>In the case of work undertaken in stages, rights or licenses to individual features may be handed over for work completed to date.</p>

                <p>Where material for the web site is sourced from elsewhere, or where third party technologies are to be used, appropriate licenses should be obtained.</p>

                <p>Websites are one of the easiest things to copy, particularly any written content and images, so registration is particularly important.</p>

                <p>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</p>

                <p>There are a lot of disabilities and conditions that can affect the way people use websites.</p>

                <p>The fact is that millions of internet users have special needs, disabilities, and impairments that can make it difficult or even impossible for them to use certain types of websites. By designing your site with these challenges in mind, you can ensure that it’s welcoming to as many users as possible.</p>

                <p>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate ﬁletypes for websites</p>

                <p>The best file formats for the web are: .PNG (Portable Network Graphic), .JPG, or also known as .JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group),  .GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), .PDF (Portable Document Format.</p>
