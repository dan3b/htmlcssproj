    <p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</p>
    
    <p>Information Technology (IT) is extremely important for all businesses to meet their day to day operational tasks and establish a secure and hassle-free communication flow. Combining IT with marketing and sales helps extend the businesses reach as well maintain fantastic customer relations. It helps businesses to make better use of production and resources, improve profitability, cost reduction over manual tasks and reduce lead times.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</p>
    
    <p>What is a digital project? A digital project comprises the planning, preparation, and production that goes into creating electronic publications. However, nowadays it can be almost anything. A software application, a website, an online campaign, etc. What is true for digital projects is that they're projects delivered as a service to the client. In terms of the overall digital project, the digital project manager should employ a methodology to their plan. KANBAN for example: Which is a visual system for managing your project work as it moves through a process.</p>
    
    <p>The main project plan processes could be broken down into the following areas:</p>
            <div class="innerItem">            
                <ul>
                    <h4>Understand the scope -  it is important first to establish the objectives of the project, which may include a budget, delivery date and goals.</h4>
                    <h4>The team - whose members usually belong to different groups and have different functions and tasks assigned by the project manager.</h4>
                    <h4>The plan - A document or chart that encompassess all the steps of the digital project.</h4>
                    <h4>Management of the project - An essential element that keeps the project on time and within budget.</h4>
                    <h4>Communication - A valuable skill and method that enables you to communicate effectively on the project with your client, team, and other stakeholders.</h4>
                    <h4>Time management - This can flex and change and is a key aspect to managing the project.</h4>
                    <h4>Deadlines - Embedded within the document or chart. Outlines timelines for tasks.</h4>
                </ul>
            </div>
    <p>With all digital projects the methods, skills and resources will be outlined in the overall project plan.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</p>
    
    <p>During this project I’ve utilised Trello. 
        <a href="https://trello.com/b/sRTEekTT/assignment-1-unit-1-dan-affen">"Here’s a link to my Trello board for this project"</a> . I’ve used it to keep track of the things I've had to do, manage my time and the overall plan as well as  prioritise tasks. My methodology has been KANBAN which I referred to on the previous page. That is, vertically laying out the Trello cards under the headers of “To do”, “In Progress” and “Completed”.</p>
    
    <p>The following link is a reference [1] <a href="https://blog.trello.com/project-management-power-ups">"How To Become A Project Management Master With Trello"</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</p>

    <p>No project is immune to failure. Lack of planning or poor planning can easily lead your project to failure. Spike Cavell's survey also revealed that 40% of projects fail due to poor planning and lack of resources. Spend time making a solid plan for your project and it will help you in executing each phase of the project smoothly.</p>

    <p>The most common reasons given for digital projects to fail were:</p>
    <div class="innerItem">            
        <ul>
            <h4>Short term priorities taking over.</h4>
            <h4>The initial scope was poorly defined (and the initial strategy / vision was unclear).</h4>
            <h4>Trying to do too much work all at once.</h4>
            <h4>Silos between marketing and IT[2]</h4>
        </ul>
        <p>Reference: [2] <a href=""></a></p>
    </div>
    <p>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</p>
    
    <p>You could just search Google for the type of system or software you need. But you need to remember that Google’s ranking is not an indication of how good the system or software is! Just because a company’s website appears at the top of Google’s results page - doesn’t mean that it will be a good fit for your business! Research is critical!  Some of the key things you will have to consider when choosing any IT system and software are:</p>
    <div class="innerItem">            
        <ul>
            <h4>Functionality</h4>
            <h4>Compatibility</h4>
            <h4>Skills and support required</h4>
            <h4>Ability to scale up</h4>
            <h4>Integration</h4>
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <h4>Management and reporting capabilities</h4>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</p>

    <p>Technology has become a very valuable asset within any digital project. The right technology can vastly improve a project's overall efficiency and outcomes, as well as improve productivity, communication, collaboration, and engagement. However, when it comes to choosing the right technology for your digital project, making the right choice can be difficult. There are numerous types of software and various tools available today. During this project, I obviously didn’t need all of them, just the right ones to suit my needs. The technologies I utilised are Trello, all products within Google Chrome, Visual Studio Code and GitHub.</p>

    <p>Trello is a collaboration tool that organises your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Imagine a cork board, filled with lists of post-it notes, with each note as a task for you and your team.</p>

    <p>Google Chrome extensions are small software programs that customise the browsing experience and enable projects. They enable users to tailor Chrome functionality and behavior to individual needs or preferences.</p>

    <p>At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more.</p>

    <p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.</p>

    <p>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</p>

    <p>This new data protection regulation puts the consumer in the driver’s seat, and the task of complying with this regulation falls upon businesses and organizations. Otherwise, you’re failing to comply. What falls under GDPR compliance?</p>

    <p>Well, GDPR applies to all businesses and organizations established in the EU, regardless of whether the data processing takes place in the EU or not. Even non-EU established organizations will be subject to GDPR. If your business offers goods and/ or services to citizens in the EU, then it’s subject to GDPR. All organizations and companies that work with personal data should appoint a data protection officer or data controller who is in charge of GDPR compliance.  There are tough penalties for those companies and organizations who don’t comply with GDPR fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. How serious is the EU taking GDPR? Extremely seriously.</p>

    <p>For example, British Airways faced an eye-watering fine that amounted to hundreds of millions or euros for failing to comply.</p>

    <p>Now, many people might think that the GDPR is just an IT issue, but that is the furthest from the truth. It has broad-sweeping implications for the whole company, including the way companies handle marketing and sales activities.</p>
