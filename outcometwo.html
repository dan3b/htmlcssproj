    <p>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</p>

    <p>Visual Studio Code is the main syntax programme that I am using. Its software enables me to write syntax in HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to achieve the end result - my own website. Visual Studio Code features a source code editor, which is perfect for me to use. VS Code helped me be extremely productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, and more.</p>

    <p>I've tested and retested the code I've written within the Chrome browser. It is extremely important to view your website in a test browser whilst you’re coding so that you can see the live changes you make otherwise it would be very difficult to judge what the end product will look like.</p>

    <p>Trello is a collaboration tool that organises your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Imagine a cork board, filled with lists of post-it notes, with each note as a task for you and your team.</p>
    
    <p>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</p>

    <p>The tools I selected were definitely appropriate as VS code is a great software tool for writing HTML and CSS. Following my attendance at the lectures on VS code, I felt quite at home. It was fairly easy to pick up.  The multiple tabs are handy to quickly switch between different HTML pages to add or make changes to them and also being able to quickly change to CSS for the same reason helps a lot</p>

    <p>Google chrome was also extremely appropriate as it was always easy to find solutions to my problems.. I never had to look very far to find an answer to an issue I was having.</p>

    <p>Trello was also appropriate as it helped with setting stages out so I had a clear roadmap of what needed to be done and what still needed completing. It can help you keep to a strict timeline so your project does not run over.</p>

    <p>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your ﬁnal project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</p>

    <p>The  website content I created contains a lot of relevant information for the project and everything works how I wanted it to and how it should. It demonstrates how much time I put  into the project and not just thrown some code together.  Given that I joined the course with absolutely no coding experience I’m happy with the outcome. The weaknesses of my website project is that it could look and work better.  With more time I could have made everything look better but artistic creativity isn't my forte.</p>

    <p>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</p>

    <p>Further improvements I could have made would be tidying everything up. For example,  having the background boxes all line up and having the text fit inside the boxes going from left to right instead of everything central and backgrounds all split up. I would use margins to set the text exactly where I wanted it similar to how I have done already. I wanted to make my links to page one and two neater as well, maye closer together all in the same bar at the top like a navbar.</p>
