                <p>3.1 Review the beneﬁts and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</p>

                <p>The tools i have used such as VS code, Trello certainly helped improve productivity and efficiency on the overall project.</p>

                <p>I feel that working in teams would of helped as we could of all been working on a separate page and we could get more work done each day however the website would also be nowhere near as personal and I couldn't just make a change to the site with what i feels look best, I would have to run it by my team to see what they thought of it first.</p>

                <p>I found Trello to be extremely good for both the individual and team projects as it really helped with efficiency. Being able to see exactly what your team is working on and what needs to be done, what has already been completed and having time scales of when things should be done increases productivity and efficiency. But the best thing was being able to see what teammates are working on in real time (as long as they update it) as this prevents the same people working on the same tasks and wasting time.</p>

                <p>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</p>

                <p>During the assignment I was productive on this project but there are of course elements I could have been more productive on. As I came to this course with absolutely no coding knowledge I really used every opportunity to expand my knowledge. It's always the case if you have previous knowledge you can be more efficient on tasks therefore increasing your productivity.</p>

                <p>There are only so many hours in the day, so making the most of your time is critical. There are two ways to increase your output--either put in more hours or work smarter. Getting the best out of the tools we used on this project certainly enabled me to work smarter. Being more productive required being more deliberate about how you manage your time.</p>

                <p>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</p>

                <p>To improve my own productivity next time I would create a team in order to assign tasks and I would also implement trello to assign those tasks to team mates. I could also try to style my site differently to see if I could get it more professional looking and less like a personal site. I’d also use Slack to communicate quickly and efficiently with my team. I feel my strengths lie in back end development rather than front end design.</p>

                <p>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</p>

                <p>The best method of testing is to individually test each part of your final project output against the project's outcomes. This way you’ll quickly find out whether every task has been completed properly.</p>
